# Learning WebDev From Scratch

I'll be putting everything from my coursework here.
This does *not* include a transcript of the classes,
but only my own notes (if any).

I won't include the text of every task and/or exercise we do,
but only the solutions.

#### Why Stibbons?

That's easy - it's for [Ponder Stibbons](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Ponder_Stibbons), 
the creator of Discworld's [Hex](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Hex).

He's the one who came to mind when I started this, and I thought it would
be fitting to use AlexStibbons as my username rather than something like
_chocolatemooossse_ or _andoneandzero_ or _daisychains_.
